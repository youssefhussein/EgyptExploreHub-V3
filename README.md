# things I (@youssefhussein) learned from this project

- mongoose hooks and schema validation
- express middleware
- ejs templating (not that good imo)
- FOR THE LOVE OF GOD! USE SOMETHING TO DEAL WITH CSS -> SASS, less, tailwind, bootstrap,etc and use it FROM THE START of the project
- learned how to use the google maps api (display maps and markers and the autocomplete feature)
- learned the difference between different types of deployments (PaaS, serverless)
- managing my API keys
- MVC architecture (honestly slowed down the development process idk if i used it wrong or if i should have split the team into different parts of the mvc)
- browser cookies and hashing passswords with bcrypt
- learned basic authentication and authorization
