   Egypt is filled to the brim with extraordinary, unique experiences that cater to every type of traveler. Whether you just want to cross off the bucket-list sites, are looking to explore Bedouin culture, or love the great outdoors, here are the best travel experiences in Egypt you shouldn’t miss when on your next trip.

TAKE A TRIP TO SIWA OASIS

Siwa Oasis sits just 50 km from the border of Libya. While in the depths of the desert, it is renowned for its off-the-beaten-track beauty and its stunning silence. Located an eight-hour drive from Cairo, offers a humbling escape from the hustle and bustle of modern life. The area is home to the Siwan Berbers, originating from North African Berber Bedouin tribes known as Amazigh. The Siwan people are famously good-natured, warm, and passionate about preserving their culture. Get ready for a rich authentic experience like no other. So it’s no surprise that legend has it that a trip to Siwa will change you forever.

SEE THE PYRAMIDS ON HORSEBACK WITH A LOCAL GUIDE

The pyramids are at the top of everyone’s bucket list, but exploring the plateau on horseback is really something else. Horses have been a large part of Egyptian life since around 1700 BC, and were traditionally used for chariots. Additionally, they were viewed as an expression of power and romance. Visiting on horseback means uninterrupted peace. With a clear view of the pyramids and tourists miles from sight, there’s no better way to soak up Egypt. Consider this excursion before or after your Best of Ancient Cairo Tour.

WATCH AN EGYPTIAN TANOURA SUFI CEREMONY


What began in Turkey as part of the Mevlevi order of Sufism has evolved into an elaborate, colorful artistic performance in Egypt known as Tanoura. Sufism is known as the mystical branch of Islam, with close to six million subscribing to the belief in Egypt. Some dancers dress traditionally in plain white robes, while others wear multiple brightly colored skirts, creating illusions and enchanting visual effects.


pEgypt’s only Sufi dance troupe puts on a performance three times a week. It takes place in the courtyard of the gorgeous Wikala of Al Ghouri. Built in 1504 AD, the wikala was designed as an inn for traders along the caravan routes. The charming Islamic architecture creates a mystical ambiance just perfect for soaking up the magic.
