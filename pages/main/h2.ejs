<p class="hop">One week in Egypt is the perfect amount of time to soak up the hum of the ancient world. An ideal first visit will include a combination of exploring archaeological highlights, cultural adventures, and relaxation. From floating down the Nile to touring temple ruins, our 7 day Egypt itinerary offers authentic experiences and bustling bazaars combined with tranquil evenings watching the sun dip beyond the sand dunes.</p>

<h1 class="KO">DAY 1</h1>

<p class="hop">
    As the heart of Egypt, many airlines offer direct services to Cairo, making the capital the best place to begin your holiday. After arrival, you will probably be buzzing to explore the city – but you’ll need a hearty meal first. Head to Cairo’s beloved Zooba, a restaurant serving up delectable traditional street food bites with a modern twist. After you’ve satisfied your appetite, the best place to spend a scorching hot Cairo afternoon is indoors at The Egyptian Museum. Showcasing over 100,000 antique relics, the museum is a must-see for every first time visitor to Egypt. Home to the Gold Mask of Tutankhamun and a plethora of mummies, history buffs may want to leave an entire day for a visit to the museum.

<p class="hop">After your trip into the past with our ancient Cairo tour, head down to the banks of the Nile and grab a steaming hot cup of coffee from one of the smiling vendors. Spend your sundown taking in the views of the Nile Corniche, before heading back to your hotel to relax.</p>



<h1 class="KO">EVENING</h1>

<p class="hop">A great way to spend your first evening in Cairo is to dive deep into the culture. Exploring Cairo by night is a whole different way to see the important landmarks of the city. Take a walk around to see the Al Hakim mosque, the Old Market, and other landmarks illuminated in the dark. </p> 

<h1 class="KO"> DAY 2</h1>

<p class="hop">Your first full day in Cairo is the perfect opportunity to explore the oldest of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Rise bright and early to grab a quick ta’ameya sandwich from a Giza street vendor before heading to the Giza pyramid complex. As the complex closes at 14:00, your best bet is to arrive early to mid-morning, while the temperature is cooler and the lines are shorter.</p>

<h1 class="KO">AFTERNOON</h1>
Expect to be exhausted after ticking the pyramids off your bucket list – so now it’s time to relax. Wind down by kicking back at Al-Azhar Park, one of the largest green spaces inside urban Cairo. Stroll through the manicured gardens, sit by the lake, or splurge on a nice treat at one of the decadent cafes on offer amongst the emerald green.

<h1 class="KO">EVENING</h1>
If you like to shop ’til you drop, Khan el-Khalili market is the place for you. The evening is a great time to explore the winding alleyways, as the weather is cooler and the ambiance is cozy. The market has been open since 1382 and boasts an amazing range of artisan gifts, incense, gold, and antiques. While you’re at the souk, be sure to check out one of Cairo’s oldest haunts, El-Fishawi cafe – established in 1797.
