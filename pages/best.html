   <h1>SUMMER: BEST FOR THE HEATSEEKER</h1>
   <img src="" alt="">
   <p class="hop">During the hot summer months, from June to August, temperatures in Egypt can reach as high as 40°C (104°F). If you were wondering just how hot is Egypt, here’s one way to find out! The plus side of this extreme heat is that it makes sightseeing easier since many attractions are open longer. But if you’re not used to sweltering temperatures, or don’t want to deal with the harsh sun all day long, then this might not be the best option for you. </p>

   <p class="hop">If summer is your only option but you’re not a fan of the heat, you may want to break up your trip by visiting Israel. The cooler temperatures in the north of Israel make it an ideal escape from the heat of Egypt, and Israel has plenty to offer, like Tel Aviv and the Old City of Jerusalem. You can also escape to the beaches along the Red Sea, which usually boast temperatures closer to 30°C (86°F) and cooling waters. In addition to beautiful beaches, you’ll find plenty of water sports like snorkeling and scuba diving in some of the world’s most spectacular coral reefs, like those in the Sinai Peninsula. Take a look at where we recommend you stay in the Sinai to best soak up the sun.</p>
   <h1>WINTER: BEST FOR THE SIGHTSEER</h1>
   <p class="hop">The winter months of December to February are the most popular time for visitors to Egypt and are generally considered the best time for sightseeing. This is when temperatures in Egypt range from a comfortable 15-20°C (60-68°F), perfect for strolling around the ancient sites and exploring. This season also sees fewer tourists, making it easier to get tickets or book accommodations without worrying about availability. </p>
   <br>
   <p class="hop">This is the best time to visit Egyptian pyramids in Cairo, one of the main reasons many people plan a trip to Egypt. The Pyramids of Giza are open from 8 am to 4 pm daily during this season, though if you want to witness a spectacular sunset over them, you’ll need to arrange for special access through your hotel or tour operator, which is something Tourist Egypt can arrange on a custom tour. Take a look at our guide of how to get to the pyramids. You could also visit iconic destinations like the Valley of Kings or cruise down the Nile, both being open year-round.</p>

<h1>SPRING: BEST FOR FESTIVAL FANS</h1>
<br>
<br>
<p class="hop">Spring is a great time to visit Egypt, as it’s the season of festivals. From April through June, the country hosts many events like Sham el Nessim (the Spring Festival) and Sinai Liberation Day in April, and potentially Ramadan, depending on when it falls throughout the year. During Ramadan, you can expect live music performances and colorful decorations throughout Egypt’s cities. If you’re looking for an exciting cultural experience with locals in a festive mood, this is the time for you! But be aware that business hours may be shortened due to fasting during Ramadan, so plan accordingly. </p>
