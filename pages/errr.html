    RELIGION
    As a Muslim majority country, Islam is practiced by about 90% of Egyptians. Because of this, it also plays a large role in every aspect of society. Also, it sets the tone for other cultural practices including honor, family values, and marriage. Traditionally, Muslims are obligated to pray five times a day, with many heading to their local mosque to partake. The times are marked by a call to prayer which echoes throughout every city and town in Egypt. It adds to the majesty of our ancient Cairo tour. The calls create a powerful ambience and remain one of the most sacred and fascinating experiences in Egypt. One major thing to note is that shops and businesses often close for prayer, so plan around these times.

Being a muslim majority country, Ramadan is a particularly fascinating time to visit Egypt. In Islam, Friday is the designated holy day. As the day of the main congregational prayer, most shops remain closed. The regular work week begins on Sunday and ends on Thursday, so make sure to plan ahead for Friday!

pEgypt’s only Sufi dance troupe puts on a performance three times a week. It takes place in the courtyard of the gorgeous Wikala of Al Ghouri. Built in 1504 AD, the wikala was designed as an inn for traders along the caravan routes. The charming Islamic architecture creates a mystical ambiance just perfect for soaking up the magic.
